**Introduction:**

This repository contains my solutions to a Finance Analysis challenge provided by SteelData. The challenge, commissioned by 'The Big Bank', involved analyzing customer banking behavior using SQL queries. The dataset included information about customer, accounts, transactions and branches. 

**Questions:**

1. What are the names of all the customers who live in New York?
2. What is the total number of accounts in the Accounts table?
3. What is the total balance of all checking accounts?
4. What is the total balance of all accounts associated with customers who live in Los Angeles?
5. Which branch has the highest average account balance?
6. Which customer has the highest current balance in their accounts?
7. Which customer has made the most transactions in the Transactions table?
8.Which branch has the highest total balance across all of its accounts?

**Conclusion:**

This SQL challenge, which required advanced concepts like Common Table Expressions (CTEs), provided valuable insights into real-world financial analysis. Solving problems related to customer banking behavior enhanced my SQL skills and deepened my understanding of financial analysis in practice. I recommend attempting this challenge independently before exploring solutions, as it offers a great learning opportunity for data enthusiasts and aspiring financial analysts.
